`^[0-9][a-zA-Z]` start: number followed by any letter

[^?.]$   any line that ends in anything other than ? or . "^" indicates matching characters NOT in the indicated class

"." refers to any character, e.g. 9-11, 9*11, 9/11 etc

`flood | fire` - match flood OR fire

^([Gg]ood | [Bb]ad) - good OR bad at start of line. () can be used to make it clear what the OR refers to

{m} exactly m matches

{m,} at least m matches

` +([a-z]+) +\1 +`: space, at least one letter, at least one space, exact same match as that between the () x 1

`^s(.*)s`: the * is greedy so it matches the longest possible string that satisfies the regex

`^s(.*?)s$`: make *it* less greedy by adding ?
